Control your computer with a gamepad.
by ben0bi @ ~2002, 2018

e.G. play the next movie in the browser or
	play your most loved adventure (Monkey Island :) ) with the gamepad.

Back in 2002 I wrote the program JoyMouse for using the joystick as a mouse.
In that time, programs where called programs and not apps. Times of wonder
and prosperity. :) But nowadays this program was way outdated, and so I 
created a new one.

This one.

I began to write BunnyPad with the Unity engine, 
but it is way more effective to make it with pure C#.

Majestic_11 is the Visual Studio Project.
I deleted the other ones.

You will find the executables in this folder:
Majestic_11/Majestic_11/bin/

It's only working for (tested with) XBox 360 and XBox One gamepads.

It will search for a controller until it found one.
If you press "Hide Me" on the main window without a controller, 
it will minimize. With a controller, it will hide completely and not 
be visible in the taskbar or somewhere else - running in the background.
You can get back the main menu by pressing the Start (Right middle) button
or by disconnecting the controller.

You can do the following stuff right now:

+ Move the mouse cursor with the left thumbstick.
+ Simulate the mouse wheel with the right thumbstick.
+ Left click with A.
+ Right click with B.
+ Press ENTER with Y.
+ Press ESC with the Back button. (Left middle button)

+ FN: Select another config by holding the left shoulder button (LS).
+ Ctrl-C with FN+A.
+ Ctrl-V with FN+B.
+ Ctrl-Z with FN+X.
+ Ctrl-Y with FN+Y.

+ Press Backspace with X

+ Slow down mouse/scrollwheel speed with the left trigger (LT).
+ Speed up mouse/scrollwheel speed with the right trigger (RT).

+ Use the arrow keys with the digital pad. 
	It waits 500ms after the first keystroke, then it will do it faster.
