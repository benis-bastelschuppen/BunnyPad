WORK IN PROGRESS

Control your computer with a gamepad.

I began to write BunnyPad with the Unity engine, 
but it is way more effective to make it with pure C#.

Majestic_11 is the Visual Studio Project. Please use that one.

It's only working for (tested with) XBox 360 and XBox One gamepads.

You can:
+ Move the mouse cursor with the left thumbstick.
+ Simulate the mouse wheel with the right thumbstick.
+ Left click with A.
+ Right click with B.
+ Slow down mouse/scrollwheel speed with the left trigger (LT).
+ Speed up mouse/scrollwheel speed with the right trigger (RT).
